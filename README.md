## üíª Step 3: Code Custom Interactions (C#)

To make your Desktop Mate interactive, write C# scripts in Unity.

### Example: Waving Animation Script
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class DesktopMate : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Animator animator;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.W))
        {
            animator.SetTrigger("Wave");
        }
    }
}
```
